# FIFA 2026: Mapping Talent, Value & Vision ⚽📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **1.2M+ player records** from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) to uncover patterns in **market value, goal contributions, age distributions, and talent pipelines** ahead of the **2026 FIFA World Cup**.  
The study integrates **statistical analysis + visualization storytelling**, culminating in a **36x48 academic poster** that highlights emerging talent, positional shifts, and cross-country player pipelines.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify **youth player dominance** and shifts in positional strengths.
- Compare **player market value trends** across 30K+ players and 400+ clubs.
- Highlight **club-to-country pipelines** and emerging football nations.
- Build compelling **multi-plot visuals** (bar, bubble, map, stacked plots) for storytelling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `sf`, `ggalluvial`, `viridis`, `rnaturalearth`  
- **Tools**: RStudio, Adobe Illustrator (for poster refinement)
